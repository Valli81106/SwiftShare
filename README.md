# SwiftShare

SwiftShare is a robust, user-friendly, and cross-platform peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing system that enables **fast, secure, and seamless transfer of files** between nearby computersâ€”without requiring internet access, USB drives, or third-party cloud storage.

## Problem Statement

Transferring files directly between devices is often slow, cumbersome, or reliant on internet-based services. Existing solutions may require complex setup, cloud accounts, or hardware like USB drives. Users need a lightweight system for quick and easy file sharing between computers, especially when switching to a new device or reformatting an old one.

## Objective

To develop a robust, user-friendly P2P file transfer system that allows secure, high-speed, and seamless sharing of files across devices from different brands and operating systems.
